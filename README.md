# HiveMindRepo

A GitHub-like creator platform: **repos as profiles**, a **social feed on publishes**, **wallet/NFT identity**, and **per-repo AI agents** (future: AI HiveMind).

## What we’re building
HiveMindRepo is a “GitHub + Social” platform where:
- **Every user account is a repo** (your profile *is* your main repository)
- **Posts are publishes** (releases) of real **snapshots/versions**
- **Remixes are forks** with automatic attribution + lineage
- **Collabs are PRs + reviews** (planned)
- **Each repo includes an embedded AI agent** that understands the repo and helps create

## Why it matters
Creators shouldn’t lose credit, context, or history.
This platform makes creation:
- **Versioned** (real timelines, rollbacks)
- **Collaborative** (review + merge workflows)
- **Remixable with credit** (lineage graph)
- **Interactive** (AI agent per repo)

## Core Features (MVP)
- Wallet sign-in (signature auth)
- Paid activation → mint **Profile NFT** (creator ID)
- Auto-create **profile repo** on activation
- Snapshots + Publish → feed items
- Follow/feed + likes/comments
- Repo AI chat (LLM now, HiveMind later)

## Roadmap (high level)
- Remix / fork lineage graph
- PR-style collaboration + reviews
- Issues/tasks + projects
- Repo vault + splits/tips (optional)

## Status
Scaffolding / planning (early build).
